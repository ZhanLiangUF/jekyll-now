This post is mainly just a storage for all the restaurants that I have been to and a place to keep my thoughts on them. Since there has been a time gap for some of these places, the recollection of my memories at these places might not be an accurate portrayal of the place. Will be adding in bulk atm.

Momofuku Noodle Bar:
- This restaurant is located on E 11th and 1st Avenue. I came here alone, so not much of a wait, but do expect at least 15-20 minute wait time for a bigger party. The lighting(huge windows) at this place is really nice, really added to the upbeat aura at this place.
- I ended up getting the Momofuku original ramen. Everything was just okay for the price. The pork belly was huge and the broth is a little smokey. But would definitely come back with friends for the vibe!

Xi-an Famous Foods:
- This restaurant is located on (in east village)St.Marks and 1st Avenue. This is my go to pick-me-up after a long day of work! I really enjoy the story behind this place. From what I've seen on the TV at this location, it's a happy story of father(the Engineer) and son(handles the business side - actually tho) working together :D.
- I have tried the lamb dumplings, spicy lambo noods, spicy oxtail noods lamb burger, liang pi cold skin noodles, and the stir fried cold skin noodles. My favorite is definitely the cold skin noodles, but damn do I wish that they can make their very spicy 3/4x more spicy. Just my opinion! But the noodles are very chewy and refreshing to the bite! The spongy gluten are a nice touch as well. Biting information from the web, Xi'an is located in the center of china, and are known for mixing cuisines from different parts of china, which makes sense.

Veselka:
- This restaurant is located on E 9th and 2nd Avenue. The first time I came here, I ordered a large borscht and had no idea what I got myself into haha. According to the interweb, Borscht is a sour soup that consists of loads of beets, and some other veggies(i think). I've never had any soup like this before, so it was a cool experience. But the second time I came back, I got pierogies and I loved it. I believe they have beef and pork/potatoes fillings.
